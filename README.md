Digital Transformation & Agentic AI: Interactive MBA Lecture

A Single-Page Interactive Application (SPA) for MBA Students

📖 Overview

This repository contains a single-file interactive web application designed to deliver an advanced MBA lecture on Digital Transformation and Agentic AI.

Moving beyond static slides, this application uses a "Single Page Application" (SPA) architecture to guide students through foundational business strategies (Drivers, Dataism) into advanced philosophical concepts (Yuval Noah Harari's "Alien Intelligence" and the rise of Autonomous Agents).

🔐 Access Credentials

The application is password-protected to simulate a gated course environment.
